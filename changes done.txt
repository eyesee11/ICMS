Changes Made to ICMS (Integrated College Management System)

1. Data Storage Format Changes:
   - Converted all .dat files to CSV format with proper headers
   - Created the following CSV files:
     * roles.csv (from roles.dat)
     * credentials.csv (from credentials.dat)
     * students.csv (from students.dat)
     * faculty.csv (from faculty.dat)
   - Deleted old .dat files after successful conversion

2. Password Change UI Improvements:
   - Added password requirement display before password change in student panel
   - Added password requirement display before password change in faculty panel
   - Requirements shown:
     * Minimum 6 characters long
     * Must contain at least one uppercase letter
     * Must contain at least one number
     * Must contain at least one special character

3. File Format Changes:
   - The system now uses CSV format for all data storage
   - CSV files include proper headers for better data organization
   - Data structure remains the same but in a more standard, readable format

4. Code Changes:
   - Modified main/ICMS.java to display password requirements
   - Added password requirement display in both student and faculty password change sections
   - No changes were needed to FileHandler.java as it was already designed to work with CSV files

5. Security Improvements in ICMS.java:
   - Enhanced role verification using auth.getUserRole() instead of direct role comparison
   - Changed course assignment to use course names instead of course IDs for better usability
   - Added more robust role checking in student and faculty access control

6. Faculty Course Assignment Improvements:
   - Modified the course assignment process to use course IDs instead of course names
   - Updated the UI to display available courses and prompt for course ID
   - Improved error messages to reference course IDs
   - Enhanced the validation to check for valid course IDs

7. Identified Edge Cases and Required Error Handling:

   Authentication System:
   - Handle password hashing failures
   - Implement concurrent login management
   - Add session timeout and logout functionality
   - Implement rate limiting for failed login attempts
   - Add password expiry mechanism
   - Force password change on first login
   - Implement account lockout after multiple failed attempts

   Student Management:
   - Prevent duplicate email addresses
   - Validate email format consistently
   - Handle student deletion with dependencies (books/courses)
   - Validate course capacity before assignment
   - Handle special characters in names
   - Implement proper stream validation

   Faculty Management:
   - Validate class assignments
   - Implement subject qualification checks
   - Handle schedule conflicts
   - Validate attendance marking dates
   - Verify student-class relationship for attendance

   Library System:
   - Implement book limit per student
   - Add damage reporting system
   - Create reservation system
   - Prevent duplicate book IDs
   - Add fine calculation system
   - Improve book search (case-insensitive, special characters)
   - Handle overdue books

   Course Management:
   - Validate course fees (prevent negative/zero)
   - Implement proper duration validation
   - Add capacity management
   - Handle course prerequisites
   - Manage course deletion with enrolled students
   - Prevent duplicate course names
   - Handle schedule conflicts

4. Email Generation System:
   - Implemented automatic email generation for students and faculty
   - Student emails now include admission year: cleanname[admissionyear].id@student.college.edu
   - Faculty emails format: cleanname.id@faculty.college.edu
   - Removed manual email input from all forms
   - Added email display after user creation
   - Prevents email duplicacy and ensures consistent format

5. Student Admission Year:
   - Added admission year field to Student model
   - Updated student creation to require admission year input
   - Added validation for admission year (2000-2100)
   - Modified CSV storage to include admission year
   - Updated student profile display to show admission year
   - Integrated admission year into email generation system

Note: The system was already set up to handle CSV files through the FileHandler class, making the transition from .dat to CSV format seamless without requiring major code changes.
