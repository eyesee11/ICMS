Changes Made to ICMS (Integrated College Management System)

1. Data Storage Format Changes:
   - Converted all .dat files to CSV format with proper headers
   - Created the following CSV files:
     * roles.csv (from roles.dat)
     * credentials.csv (from credentials.dat)
     * students.csv (from students.dat)
     * faculty.csv (from faculty.dat)
   - Deleted old .dat files after successful conversion

2. Password Change UI Improvements:
   - Added password requirement display before password change in student panel
   - Added password requirement display before password change in faculty panel
   - Requirements shown:
     * Minimum 6 characters long
     * Must contain at least one uppercase letter
     * Must contain at least one number
     * Must contain at least one special character

3. File Format Changes:
   - The system now uses CSV format for all data storage
   - CSV files include proper headers for better data organization
   - Data structure remains the same but in a more standard, readable format

4. Code Changes:
   - Modified main/ICMS.java to display password requirements
   - Added password requirement display in both student and faculty password change sections
   - No changes were needed to FileHandler.java as it was already designed to work with CSV files

5. Security Improvements in ICMS.java:
   - Enhanced role verification using auth.getUserRole() instead of direct role comparison
   - Changed course assignment to use course names instead of course IDs for better usability
   - Added more robust role checking in student and faculty access control

Note: The system was already set up to handle CSV files through the FileHandler class, making the transition from .dat to CSV format seamless without requiring major code changes.
